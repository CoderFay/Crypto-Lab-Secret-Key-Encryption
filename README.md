<h1>Seed Labs </h1>
<h4>This lab has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 VM</h4>

<h6>Task 2 of the Secret-key Encryption Lab involves experimenting with various encryption algorithms and modes.  I used the openssl enc command to encrypt and decrypt a file, including -aes-128-cbc, -bf-cbc, -aes-128-cfb, and more. Through the use of command-line options, such as -in, -out, -e, -d, -K, and -iv.</h6>
